> **Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
> The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.
> 
> **Antimagic Susceptibility.** The hut is incapacitated while the magic gem that animates it is in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the hut must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
> 
> **Siege Monster.** The hut deals double damage to objects and structures.
